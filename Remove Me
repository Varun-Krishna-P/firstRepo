To remove a file from Git, you have to remove it from your tracked files (more accu-
rately, remove it from your staging area) and then commit. The
git rm
command does
that and also removes the file from your working directory so you don’t see it as an
untracked file next time around.
If you simply remove the file from your working directory, it shows up under the
“Changed but not updated” (that is,
unstaged
) area of your
git status
output:
$ rm grit.gemspec
$ git status
# On branch master
#
# Changed but not updated:
# (use "git add/rm <file>..." to update what will be committed)
#
# deleted: grit.gemspec
#
Then, if you run
git rm
, it stages the file’s removal:
$ git rm grit.gemspec
rm ’grit.gemspec’
$ git status
# On branch master
#
# Changes to be committed:
# (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)
#
# deleted: grit.gemspec
