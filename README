Readme
This is the first sample Repo in git that I am creating now.....
These are the following commands I had learnt now
1. git init
2. git status
3. git add
4. git diff
4.1 git diff --staged
4.2 git diff --cached
5. git commit
5.1 git commit - v also puts the duff of your change in the editor so you can see exactly what you did.

Before commiting make sure to remove some unwanted space things.
 <osse> --cached and --staged mean the same thing
[11:41] <grawity> 'cache' is the old name for the staging area, AFAIK
[11:41] <osse> and 'index' is the current :p
If the git status command is too vague for you- you want to know exactly what you changed, not just which files were changed.- you can use git diff command.

I am not seeing the changes but not updated
git add is a multi purpose command which may be used for the following
1. to start tracking
2. to stage files
3. to deal with merge conflict.
